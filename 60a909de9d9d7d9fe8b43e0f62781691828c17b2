      "message": "This seems to rely on the fact that the postCompleteConfig.type enum class is zero-initialized, which looks like it is defined behavior from what I have found, so I think it should be okay.\n\nMy only hesitation is that this is different from how we handle the other optional signals where we check for the name to be empty such as on line 2963:\n```\nif (!nmiOutConfig.lineName.empty())\n```\n\nOtherwise, this does save the additional empty line check, so it\u0027s potentially more efficient.  So, I\u0027m okay with this approach.",

IMO, it would be nicer to have something like an \"isPresent\" method, but I didn\u0027t want to go change the whole file as I don\u0027t have access to a fully featured intel platform.",
