      "message": "x86-power-control doesn\u0027t feel like the right place for this change.  I think it would make more sense to add a match for the CurrentHostState property in the host watchdog service and start and stop the timer based on that match.  You can find an example match in currentHostStateMonitor().\n\nIf x86-power-control is really the best place, we can put it in.",
