      "message": "I\u0027m not necessarily opposed to this feature, but this example sounds like a problem with under-specified service dependencies -- i.e. x86-power-control starting before another service that provides the dbus object it\u0027s going to be looking for.  Are there cases of this sort of problem arising even with properly specified dependencies?",

Unfortunately, even when x86-power-control is defined to run after service that creates needed DBus interfaces, I\u0027ve observed problem with exception. The problem is that second service doesn\u0027t create all of its interfaces right away, and as result they don\u0027t exist yet when x86-power-control starts.",
