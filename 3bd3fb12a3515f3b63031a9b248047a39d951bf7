      "message": "This description comes from my experience with AMD boards (Ethanol/EthanolX/DaytonaX). In all of them BMC_READY goes to CPLD, and CPLD is responsible for launching all power to the board.\nSo BIOS wouldn\u0027t even have a change to run if BMC_READY is inactive.\nHow do you suggest to change it?",

For example manually with a button. And I think we don\u0027t want to delay this functionality for too long for the user experience.\nAlso activation of this pin should be done before restoring any power policy.",
