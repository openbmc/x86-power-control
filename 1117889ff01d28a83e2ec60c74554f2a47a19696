(Manually running clang-format locally I get the same result with both 14 and 15.)  clang-format often seems like a pretty mysterious and unpredictable beast to me I have to say...unless someone else knows what\u0027s going on here, I guess I\u0027d just say fix it manually to make it consistent with the rest of the code?",
