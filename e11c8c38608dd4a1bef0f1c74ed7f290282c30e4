It\u0027s true that NMI doesn\u0027t mean anything when the host is off, but the NMI button is user-facing, so it seems useful to know if users are messing with buttons regardless of the state of the host.\n\nIf hardware-specific patching isn\u0027t an option, perhaps this filter could be added as a build or configuration option?",

I suppose it\u0027s conceivable that there could be situations in which it could be useful for some sort of post-mortem debugging or something?\n\nThe main problem we have is that on the hardware we\u0027ve got that produces these spurious button-press events when the host shuts off, the logged events manifest as `CRITICAL`-level errors in the redfish event log, so in the web UI it looks like there\u0027s something deeply wrong with the system even when the only thing that\u0027s happened is a totally healthy shutdown.\n\n\u003e If hardware-specific patching isn\u0027t an option, perhaps this filter could be added as a build or configuration option?\n\nA hardware-specific patch is what we\u0027re currently using internally, but we\u0027d of course prefer to get something upstream instead, and patches in upstream OpenBMC have (quite reasonably, IMO) been disallowed for a while now.  I think it would be preferable to avoid increasing the number of compile-time options; perhaps we could add a config sub-section looking something like this?  (Arranged so as to be extensible to other event-logging customization.)\n\n```\n{\n  \"gpio_configs\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"timing_configs\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"logging\": {\n    \"LogNMIButtonPressWhenPoweredOff\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe name is a bit verbose, but I couldn\u0027t think of anything more concise that was still reasonably self-explanatory.  (Open to suggestions for better alternatives if anyone has any.)",

Essentially, I look at the NMI button as nothing more than a dummy GPIO that users can control from the front panel.\n\nI guess I\u0027m cautious about BMC filtering events as I feel like we get into as much or more trouble for missing real events as for logging spurious ones.ðŸ˜Š\n\nI\u0027m still mulling over what might be affected by filtering the NMI event when the host is off, but here are some of my other thoughts:\n- If the event was \"OK\" severity, would that help? I see that both the Power and Reset button press events are \"OK\". I don\u0027t know why NMI was considered more critical than those, so it would make sense to me to reduce the severity of the button press to \"OK\".\n- Instead of filtering just the logging on host-off, we could filter the entire event (setting the source, pulsing the output GPIO, etc.). Would that make the config option easier to write?  Maybe something like:\n```\n\"event_configs\": {\n   \"NMIWhenPoweredOff\": false\n}\n```",

I guess an NMI does seem a bit more out of the ordinary than power or reset button events though...maybe a warning or something in between the two instead?\n\n\u003e Instead of filtering just the logging on host-off, we could filter the entire event (setting the source, pulsing the output GPIO, etc.).\n\nSo have the config option just make it ignore the NMI button entirely when the host is off?
