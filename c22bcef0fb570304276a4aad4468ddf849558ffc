      "message": "I *think* I basically understand the broad gist of this, but a more detailed explanation would be good.  For example, to what extent are we ignoring things?  From a quick skim of the patch, it looks like maybe it\u0027s just that we keep silent on the State.OperatingSystem dbus interface, but otherwise continue as we were?  (i.e. with the internal state machine continuing to transition as it would anyway, and the power-state dbus interface still reflecting the activity?)\n\n(The commit message formatting is also a bit off, see https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting-commit-messages.)",

      "message": "The goal of this patch is to ignore soft resets that the host may send before POSTing.  These soft resets will overwrite the previous restart cause which can have more meaningful info like the power restore policy.\n\nSince these soft resets are expected in some cases I\u0027m adding this option for the BMC to ignore them.",
