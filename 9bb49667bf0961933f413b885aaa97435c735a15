      "message": "I may be mistaken (I\u0027m not a C++ guru), but I think as-is this will lead to undefined behavior by dereferencing a dangling reference, because this function (with a local copy of `config`) returns, leaving the callback function in the `.async_wait()` with a stale `name` reference.  (Changing the `config` parameter to a reference as suggested above should fix it though, I think.)",

      "message": "Perhaps I\u0027m misunderstanding what\u0027s going on here, but does this imply we\u0027re going to have config bits like `\"Polarity\": \"1\"`, with a string value for the key, instead of `\"Polarity\": 1` with a numeric value?  If so, I\u0027m a bit confused as to why...\n\nI\u0027m somewhat tempted to suggest having this config item be a json bool (\"ActiveLow\" or something) so as to avoid the question of what meaning to assign integer values other than zero and one, though I guess that might be a bit more invasive to apply back to all the existing signals...",
