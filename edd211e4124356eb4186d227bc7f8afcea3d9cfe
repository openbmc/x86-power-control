Perhaps @stwcx not commenting on that should be taken as implicit approval, but I\u0027d be a bit curious to hear about the reasoning either way.

If you wanted to add service dependencies, those are driven by the content of the JSON, which systemd isn\u0027t going to see.  You\u0027d have to have the system owner give both a JSON and a systemd-conf for the x86-power-control service.  On the surface, if we can have the daemon do something reasonable, on its own, that the users are comfortable with, then that seems like a less complex answer right now.",
