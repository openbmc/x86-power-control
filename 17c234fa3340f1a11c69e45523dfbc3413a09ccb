      "message": "This looks okay. It hasn\u0027t been needed before because the reset button immediately triggers other signals such as `postCompleteDeAssert` or `pltRstAssert` that move to the `checkForWarmReset` state. This will just move the state slightly earlier depending on hardware delays.\n\nDoes your system respond immediately to the reset button and change other signals that move to `checkForWarmReset`?  If so, this seems redundant to those signals.",
