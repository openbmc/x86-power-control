      "message": "If the repository is called x86-power-control, I am assuming that it should have the necessary hooks to accommodate Intel/AMD way of doing the power sequence. The number and purpose of the GPIOs will differ/vary between AMD/Intel platforms. In order to get the AMD power sequencing working properly, we would have to add additional GPIOs which may not be required in Intel/other platforms. However, since we want to re-use x86-power-control without having to fork, need guidance on how to get additional GPIOs for power sequencing which will be optional for other platforms. We are not particular on the naming, we can rename it to power_sequence_ready or something similar. \"BMC_READY\" may be a misnomer, it\u0027s just a signal to FPGA to start honoring requests from BMC.",

      "message": "Yes, we can work to make x86-power-control common for AMD power sequencing.  The question is if `bmcReady` is really only for power-control or if it is more.  For example, if x86-power-control comes up before IPMI, is the host system going to be okay that BMC_READY was asserted but it gets no response over IPMI?\n\nI think the confusion is if `bmcReady` means more than just ready for power-control, then x86-power-control alone isn\u0027t sufficient.  Perhaps we can remove this from this commit and resolve it in the other where discussion is already happening? https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/x86-power-control/+/48951",
